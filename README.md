# mousetrails
Does what it says on the tin. Windows only. I use mouse trails because I have the bad eyes. Sometimes
games and other malevolent actors turn them off, this is a very fast way to turn them back on.

## Build
`> dotnet publish -r win-x64 -c release`

## run
mousetrails [on|off]

If the argument isn't provided or recognized it will tell you the state of the Windows mouse trails.
